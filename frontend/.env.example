# ============================================================
# Frontend Environment Variables (Vite)
# Copy this file to .env.production (or .env) and fill in your values:
#   cp .env.example .env.production
#
# All variables MUST start with VITE_ to be exposed to the browser.
# ============================================================
#
# PHILOSOPHY: Only 2 vars needed. Everything else (appearance,
# payments, chatbot, etc.) is configured from Admin Panel UI
# and loaded at runtime from the backend API.
#
# In development (localhost), these auto-detect and default to:
#   VITE_API_URL  → http://localhost:5001/api
#   VITE_BASE_URL → http://localhost:5173
# So you only need this file for production builds.
#
# ============================================================

VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api    # Backend API (Nginx proxies /api → :5001)
VITE_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com       # Frontend public URL

# ============================================================
# NOTES:
# - Run `npm run build` after changing these values.
# - Stripe/PayPal publishable keys are fetched from the backend
#   at runtime, NOT from env vars here.
# - DNS + SSL handled by Cloudflare (proxy mode).
# - Deploy is automated via GitHub Actions (push to main).
