# Usability and System Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The "TechStore" application is a functional e-commerce platform with a basic "Mini ERP" (Admin Dashboard) for management. While the core features (browsing, cart, checkout, admin management) are present, there are significant opportunities to improve user experience (UX), system reliability, and code maintainability.

## 1. Usability Analysis (Frontend)

### Strengths
- **Visual Design:** Clean and modern interface with a clear hierarchy.
- **Core Flow:** The path from product browsing to checkout is straightforward.
- **Admin Features:** Basic CRUD operations for products and users are functional.

### Weaknesses & Pain Points
- **Navigation:**
  - The application uses manual state-based routing (`activePage` state) instead of a proper routing library (like `react-router-dom`). This breaks the browser's "Back" button functionality, leading to a frustrating user experience.
- **Cart Experience:**
  - Cart data is stored in `localStorage` and is not synced with the backend for logged-in users. If a user logs in on a different device, their cart will be empty.
- **Feedback & Validation:**
  - "Loading" states are often just text.
  - Form validation is basic.
  - Error messages (e.g., out of stock) are sometimes delivered via `alert()`, which is intrusive and outdated.
- **Checkout:**
  - "Coming Soon" payment methods are displayed prominently, potentially confusing users who expect them to work.
  - Guest checkout creates "ghost" user accounts in the database, which might clutter user management.

## 2. Mini ERP / Admin Dashboard Analysis

### Current State
The "Mini ERP" is currently a set of lists for Products, Orders, and Users. It lacks high-level insights.

### Missing Features
- **Dashboard Overview:** No summary view (e.g., "Total Sales Today", "Low Stock Alerts", "Pending Orders").
- **Inventory Management:** No visual indicators for low stock items in the main list.
- **Order Management:**
  - Filtering is basic.
  - No way to print invoices or packing slips.
- **Data Visualization:** No charts or graphs to track sales trends.

## 3. Technical & Backend Analysis

### Critical Issues
- **Database Schema:** The `orders` table was missing the `payment_method` column definition, which would cause order creation to fail (Fixed in this session).
- **Data Integrity:** Address information is stored as a single unstructured text string, making it hard to analyze shipping data or integrate with shipping providers later.

### Codebase
- **Routing:** Lack of client-side routing makes the frontend code harder to maintain and scale.
- **State Management:** Local state is used extensively. As the app grows, a global state manager (Context API or Redux) might be needed, especially for the Cart.

## 4. Recommendations for Updates

### Immediate Priority (High Impact / Low Effort)
1.  **Dashboard Overview:** Add a "Home" tab to the Admin Dashboard with key statistics (Sales, Orders, Users).
2.  **Stock Alerts:** Highlight products with low stock (e.g., < 5 units) in the Admin Product list.
3.  **UX Improvements:** Replace `alert()` with toast notifications.

### Medium Priority (Strategic)
1.  **Implement Routing:** Refactor `App.jsx` to use `react-router-dom`.
2.  **Cart Sync:** Connect the frontend Cart component to the existing backend Cart API to sync items across devices for logged-in users.
3.  **Structured Address:** Refactor the database and frontend to store address fields (Street, City, Zip) separately.

### Long Term
1.  **Payment Integration:** Implement Stripe or PayPal for real online payments.
2.  **Email Notifications:** Integrate an email service (like SendGrid) to send real order confirmations.
